# üöç Excited to Share My Project: Bus Tracker App in Halifax! üåç

A small project with JavaScript DOM manipulation, Leaflet (https://leafletjs.com), and SASS.
The application consumes two lives API, one from Halifax's buses (https://hrmbusapi.herokuapp.com) and Halifax's weather (http://api.weatherapi.com). 

I design a bus tracker app for Halifax, Nova Scotia transit buses. The app tracks real-time bus geo-locations, speed, and other relevant information.

Here's how it works:
The app uses an API to pull in bus position data.
I leveraged JavaScript asynchronous functions and fetch to obtain the data seamlessly.
For mapping, I used Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library, to display the bus locations on an interactive map.
The map is periodically updated to ensure you get real-time updates on transit bus positions.
It was a rewarding project that helped me dive deeper into working with APIs, real-time data handling, and interactive mapping. I'm excited to share this with my network and continue building innovative solutions that make a difference.
