# Bus Map Application

A small project with JavaScript DOM manipulation, Leaflet (https://leafletjs.com), and SASS.

The application consumes two lives API, one from Halifax's buses (https://hrmbusapi.herokuapp.com) and Halifax's weather (http://api.weatherapi.com). 

The buses are placed according to their live locations on a Leaflet's map.

The weather widget displays the current weather from Halifax.

That was created as part of an assignment for my college.
